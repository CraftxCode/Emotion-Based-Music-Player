# Emotion-Based-Music-Player
I developed a high-level project ‚ÄúEmotion Based Music Player‚Äù that detects emotion via camera, voice, or manual selection and instantly plays matching songs, including online streaming. A working demo video is available. Contact me if you‚Äôre interested in buying or need the project. Phone: 03219211464.

An advanced, AI-driven Python application that detects user emotion from **camera**, **voice**, or **manual input** and plays songs that match the detected mood.  
Supports both **offline music libraries** and **online streaming** for a seamless listening experience.
